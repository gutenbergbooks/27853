<h2><a name="OLD_GLORY" id="OLD_GLORY"></a>OLD GLORY</h2>


<p class="cap">WHILE every American citizen recognizes
the significance of the term &ldquo;Old Glory&rdquo; as
applied to the national flag, when and where and
by whom the nation&rsquo;s emblem was christened with
this endearing and enduring sobriquet is a matter
of historic interest less understood.</p>

<p class="ind">In the early epoch-making period of the nation&rsquo;s
history William Driver, a lad of twelve years,
native of Salem, Mass., begged of his mother
permission to go to sea. With her consent he
shipped as cabin boy on the sailing vessel <i>China</i>,
bound for Leghorn, a voyage of eighteen months.</p>

<p class="ind">On this first voyage the courageous spirit of
the youth manifested itself in a determination
to disprove the words of the ship&rsquo;s owner, made
to him at the beginning of the voyage: &ldquo;All
boys on their first voyage eat more than they
earn.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">In appreciation of the mettle shown by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
lad, the owner presented him, upon the return
from the cruise, with twenty-eight dollars in
silver, besides his wages of five dollars per month.
He carried the money to his mother, who wisely
admonished him to do the very best he could
under every circumstance, a charge he never
forgot.</p>

<p class="ind">His intrepid spirit brought the youthful mariner
rapid and deserved promotion. His eighteenth
year found him master of a vessel. Those
were hazardous days upon the sea, and more
than once his ship was subjected to indignity
and outrage incident to seafaring of that period.
But throughout a long career as master of a
merchantman the Stars and Stripes was never
lowered from the masthead nor sullied by defeat
or by dishonor.</p>

<span class="caption">Captain William Driver.</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">The sailor, of all men, venerates his nation&rsquo;s
flag. To him it is the visible and tangible token
of the government he serves, and in it he beholds
all the government&rsquo;s strength and virtue. To
William Driver, therefore, the Stars and Stripes
typified the glory of the land and of the sea.
And seeing his nation&rsquo;s symbol float dauntless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and triumphant above stress of every encounter
and happening upon the deep enkindled the
inherent love in his heart for it to enthusiastic
ardor, and in thought he called the flag &ldquo;Old
Glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">A simple incident, but fraught with unread
meaning, gave the name into the nation&rsquo;s keep,
albeit its formal christening and national adoption
was not to come until the soil beneath its folds
should be deep-dyed with the blood of conflict
between the land&rsquo;s own countrymen.</p>

&ldquo;Old Glory.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="ind">In 1831, as master of the brig <i>Charles Daggett</i>,
about to set sail for a voyage around the world
from Salem, Mass., Captain Driver was presented
by the citizens with a large bunting flag in commendation
of his services upon the sea and his
well-known love for his country&rsquo;s emblem. This
flag, when presented, was rolled in the form of a
triangle, and the halyards bent. A young sailor,
stepping forward, said: &ldquo;In ancient times, when
an ocean voyage was looked upon with superstitious
dread, it was the custom on the eve of
departure to roll the banner in form of a triangle.
When ready and bent like this, a priest stepped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
forward and, taking the banner in his hand,
sprinkled it with consecrated water and dedicated
it to &lsquo;God the Father, God the Son, and God
the Holy Ghost,&rsquo; turning the point of the triangle
upward at the name of each, thus calling on that
sacred unity of Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier
to bless the national emblem and prosper the
voyagers and their friends. The flag thus consecrated
was then hoisted to the masthead.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">With glistening eyes the captain watched the
hoisting of the flag; and as it fell into position at
the masthead of his ship and the colors unfurled
to the breeze, he shouted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call her Old
Glory, boys, Old Glory!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Cheer after cheer rent the air. The signals of
departure were sounded, the cables were cast
off, and the good ship set sail for foreign ports.</p>

<p class="ind">This was the ninth and most memorable voyage
made by Captain Driver. From the island
of Tahiti he rescued the suffering descendants of
the mutineers of the English ship <i>Bounty</i>, and at
risk of grave considerations turned his vessel
from her outlined course and returned them to
their beautiful and longed-for home, Pitcairn,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the waters of the South Pacific, the settlement
of an island, which marks one of the memorable
events of English naval history.</p>

<p class="ind">Captain Driver made his last voyage around
the globe in command of the <i>Black Warrior</i>.
At the masthead flew his Salem flag, Old Glory,
to which he never referred but by that loving
pseudonym.</p>

<p class="ind">He left the sea in 1837 to become a resident of
Nashville, Tenn. He carried Old Glory with
him as a sacred relic, carefully deposited in a
heavy, brass-bound, camphorwood sea chest that
had accompanied him on all his voyages. On
legal holidays, on St. Patrick&rsquo;s day (which was
his own birthday), and on days of especial celebration
in the Southern city Old Glory was
released from confinement and thrown to the
light from some window of the Driver residence
or hung on a rope across the street in a triumphal
arch under which all processions passed.</p>

<p class="ind">At the outbreak of the civil strife Captain
Driver avowed his Union sympathies and stood
openly for his convictions in the face of business
losses, arrest, and threatened banishment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/ip010.jpg" width="600" height="410" alt="The Chest" title="The Chest" />
<span class="caption">The Chest in which &ldquo;Old Glory&rdquo; Rested.</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">Just after the secession of the State he daringly
flaunted his Old Glory flag from his window;
then, fearing its confiscation (which his action
had rendered liable), he procured a calico quilt
of royal purple hue, and with the aid of two
neighboring women sewed it up between the
coverings and hid the quilt in his old sea chest.</p>

<p class="ind">Again and again the house was searched by
Confederate soldiers for this flag, but without
success.</p>

<p class="ind">Under the purple Old Glory rested. The
flag of the Confederacy waved above the Capitol;
and Nashville, in pride, prosperity, and splendor,
basked in the promise of ultimate victory to
the Southland.</p>

<p class="ind">But to a rude awakening this fancied security
was foredoomed. Suddenly, like the breaking
of a terrific thunderclap above the city, came
the awesome cry: &ldquo;Fort Donelson has fallen!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Fort Donelson fallen meant Nashville&rsquo;s subjection.
Terror-stricken, the people rushed wildly
in every direction, and the most ill-founded
reports in the excitement gained ready credence.
It was announced that General Buell would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
speedily arrive and open his batteries from across
the river, and that gunboats would lay the city
in ruins. Some of the citizens urged the burning
of the city, that no spoils might be left to the
enemy.</p>

<p class="ind">The fine suspension bridge across the Cumberland
was fired. The commissaries were thrown
open, and vast quantities of public stores, amounting
to millions of dollars, were distributed among
the inhabitants or destroyed. The archives of
the State were hurriedly conveyed to Memphis.
In the mad desire to escape an impending doom
of whose nature they were wholly ignorant,
residents vacated their houses and left priceless
furnishings a prey to the invading army. On
foot, on horseback, by wagon, by any available
means that best favored their flight, the crowds
surged out of the conquered city.</p>

<p class="ind">Notwithstanding the apprehensions of speedy
hostilities, it was a week later before General
Buell was encamped in Edgefield, opposite the
city. To him the mayor formally surrendered
Nashville. A proclamation was issued assuring the
inhabitants of protection in person and property.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">Up the Cumberland steamed fifteen transports
and one gunboat&mdash;General Nelson&rsquo;s wing of
the Union army. From the levee came the clamor
and shouts of men, the rattle of musketry, and
din of many feet. The Sixth Ohio was the first
regiment to land. Captain Driver was an interested
observer of the scene. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;hath the hour of Old Glory come!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Lieutenant Thacher, of the Sixth, with a squad
of soldiers, left the regiment and escorted Captain
Driver to his home, a few blocks distant. They
wrested Old Glory from its hiding place and, with
the old mariner bearing the flag in his arms,
quickly rejoined the regiment.</p>

<p class="ind">Up the hill, amidst rattle of drum and sounding
trumpets, passed the bluecoats to the Capitol.
There a small regimental flag was being hoisted.
Suddenly a hush fell upon the waiting victors.
The figure of Captain Driver appeared high
against the dome of the Statehouse. The strains
of &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; burst upon the
ear; and amid cheers and cries of &ldquo;Old Glory!
Old Glory!&rdquo; that echoed to the distant hills the
old sea flag unfurled and floated above the top
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
most
pinnacle of the Capitol of Tennessee.
And thus Old Glory received her formal christening.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">Amid cheers and cries of &ldquo;Old Glory! Old Glory!&rdquo; that echoed to the Distant
hills the old sea flag unfurled and floated above the topmost
pinnacle of the Capitol of Tennessee.</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">Swarming over the city, bent on various quests,
went the victorious Federals. Not so the old
sailor. The revered flag, flaunting the colors so
joyously above his head once more, was far too
weather-beaten, he feared, to withstand long the
stiff breeze blowing about the elevated site. Torn
to ribbons it must not be, howsoever good the
cause.</p>

<p class="ind">Quietly he watched and waited about the
grounds until after nightfall, when, under cover
of the darkness, he again ascended the dome,
rescued his beloved old flag, and swung in its
place a big merino one that had figured as a
campaign flag in 1840, when &ldquo;Tippecanoe and
Tyler too&rdquo; was the slogan of the Whig Party.
He then carried Old Glory to his home and laid
it tenderly away in the old sea locker so long
dedicated to its use.</p>

<p class="ind">Very gradually thereafter the pleasing appellation,
Old Glory, made its impress upon the speech
of the populace, until, in the later nineties, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hoosier Poet&rdquo; was moved to expression in
verse:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old Glory, the story we&rsquo;re wanting to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is what the plain facts of your christening were,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Repeat it and cheer it, s&rsquo;tang to the spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As salt as a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeing you fly and the boys marching by,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And an aching to live for you always or die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, by our love for you floating above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the scars of all wars and the sorrows thereof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave you the name of Old Glory?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig">

</p>
</div>

<p class="ind">But to the query the sealed lips of the old
seaman answered not. For him had come the
higher summons.</p>

<p class="ind">Captain Driver&rsquo;s death occurred in Nashville
in 1886. At the head of his grave, in the old
City Cemetery, stands a unique monument of his
own designing. Upon an old tree trunk, in stone,
appears a ship&rsquo;s anchor and cable. At the top
of the anchor is inscribed the beloved pseudonym
of his heart&rsquo;s own coinage, above him here, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in his last sleep: &ldquo;His ship, his country, and his
flag&mdash;Old Glory.&rdquo; About his body when placed
within the casket was wrapped a United States
flag.</p>

<p class="ind">A few years prior to his death Captain Driver
placed his Old Glory flag in the hands of his elder
daughter, Mrs. Roland, of Wells, Nev., who was
then on a visit to him, saying brokenly as he
resigned it: &ldquo;Take this flag and cherish it as I
have done. I love it as a mother loves her child.
It has been with me, and it has protected me in
all parts of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Worn and faded and tattered, this flag is still
in the possession of Mrs. Roland; and in her far
Western home it is displayed on patriotic occasions
and the story of its naming repeated. Another,
presumably the Whig flag herein mentioned, and
that, as has been shown, also flew over the Capitol
of Tennessee, was sent by Captain Driver,
upon request, to the Essex Institute, of Massachusetts.
Some confusion has of late arisen in
the public mind regarding the identity of the two
flags, it having been generally believed that the
original Old Glory was the flag in the Massachusetts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Institute. This impression is, however, doubtless
erroneous.</p>

<p class="ind">Notwithstanding a somewhat brusque address
and a marked individuality of speech and action,
Captain Driver was a man of warm and kindly
nature. Although a stanch Unionist, he lent a
ready and willing hand to the suffering ones of
the South. He married the first time Miss
Martha Babbage, of Salem, Mass. For his
second wife he espoused a Southern woman,
Sarah J. Parks, of Nashville, Tenn. Two of
his sons bore arms in the Confederate service.
One of these gave his life for the &ldquo;lost cause.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;" />

<p class="ind">It remained for yet another conflict after the
civil strife to bring the name Old Glory into
general and popular use, <span class="smcap">for the blended ranks
of the Blue and the Gray opposed a common
foe</span>. When the North and the South joined hands
against a foreign power and floated the Stars and
Stripes above the emblem of Spain upon the
island of Cuba, the flag of the Union became Old
Glory to every man of the nation.

<div class="blockquot"><p class="ind">&ldquo;History points no struggle for liberty which has in it more

<p class="cap">THEY were a godly people, these revolutionary

but infants in age as compared with other subjects

<p class="ind">When, therefore, Old England announced, &ldquo;You

</div>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;If you can,&rdquo; was
the answer.</p>

<p class="ind">A British fleet then
sailed into Boston
harbor, and British
soldiers swarmed over
Boston town. This
action enraged the
citizens. It angered
the &ldquo;Sons of Liberty,&rdquo;
whose name is self-explanatory
and
whose slogan was
&ldquo;Liberty or Death,&rdquo;
and inspired them to
more vigorous efforts
toward freedom from
Britain&rsquo;s power. The
&ldquo;Minute Men&rdquo; were
organized and stood
ready to the summons,
ready at a minute&rsquo;s
notice to leave
forest, field, or fire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>side,
to take up arms in defense of their liberties
and their rights.</p>

<p class="ind">The spirit of dissension ran rife; and petty
altercations between the British soldiers and the
citizens were of daily occurrence. A trivial happening
brought about the Boston Massacre.
A &ldquo;Son of Liberty&rdquo; and a British soldier disputed
the right of way of a street passage.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Stand aside,&rdquo; said the one.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Give way,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p class="ind">Neither would yield. Blows followed. Rocks
flew. The soldiers marshaled and fired into the
crowd. Several citizens were killed. The town
was ablaze with excitement. And the governor
had finally to withdraw the troops from Boston.</p>

<p class="ind">When antagonism had abated in degree, King
George devised new measures of taxation and
stirred ill feeling again. Boston brewed British
tea in the ocean. England disliked the taste of
it. The people were declared Rebels; and the
charter of Massachusetts was annulled by Parliament.
Ten thousand British soldiers then came
over. Boston Neck was seized and fortified.
The colonists were to be forced into obedience.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">Then from Lexington and Concord the signals

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="ind">The Battle of Bunker Hill that followed was
but the natural sequence. Defeated though the
patriots were in this their first real battle, it was
a defeat that spelled for them ultimate victory.
This they recognized dimly, but certainly, as
they knew that they had gone into battle with a
prayer on their lips for themselves, for their
homes, and their country. Their hearts were
fired anew for freedom. Their arms would be
strengthened to their desires. As the lights from
the belfry of Old North Church revealed to Paul
Revere the route the British were to take against
them in the memorable beginnings at Lexington
and Concord, so the light from the Great Book
above its chancel rail would direct them the way
they should go.

<h2><a name="THE_FLAG_OF_FORT_STANWIX" id="THE_FLAG_OF_FORT_STANWIX"></a>THE FLAG OF FORT STANWIX</h2>


<p class="cap">TRITE but true is the old adage that necessity
is the mother of invention. The first flag
that flew over an American fort was constructed
from an &ldquo;ammunition shirt, a blue jacket captured
from the British, and a woman&rsquo;s red petticoat.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The garrison at Fort Stanwix (Fort Schuyler)
had no flag; but it had possession of the fort
despite the siege of twenty days against it by
the British; and it had five British standards
taken from the enemy. So it improvised a flag
and, with cheers and yells befitting the occasion,
ran the British standards upside down upon the
flag mast and swung the Stars and Stripes above
them. The redcoats looked, and, it is safe to
assert, laughed not, as to them the humor of the
situation was not appealing. But if they were
lacking in the sense of humor, these sons of Old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
England were not lacking in persistence, and they
besieged the fort with steady determination.</p>

<p class="ind">Fort Stanwix stood at the head of navigation
of the Mohawk River and was an important feature
in the plan of General Burgoyne to cut off
New England from the southern colonies and thus
control the whole country. Embarking upon this
expedition, he had instructed his army: &ldquo;The
services required are critical and conspicuous.
Difficulty, nor labor, nor life are to be regarded.
The army must not retreat.&rdquo; As he advanced
down the Hudson he swept everything before
him. Ticonderoga, Mount Defiance, Whitehall,
Fort Edward, each in turn fell: and he now
anticipated no successful resistance to his forces.</p>

<p class="ind">At the beginning of General Burgoyne&rsquo;s invasion
a force of Canadians, Hessians, New York
Tories, and Indians commanded by General St.
Leger had been sent against Fort Stanwix. The
post was held by General Gansevoort with some
seven hundred and fifty men. They were ill supplied
with ammunition and had few provisions.
To Burgoyne defeat seemed here impossible. The
siege had, however, been anticipated by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
garrison, and the men had determined to hold
out to the last extremity.</p>

<p class="ind">Word was surreptitiously conveyed to Colonel
Willett within the fort that General Herkimer
would set out with eight hundred volunteers to
reënforce him and that a successful sortie might
be made against the besiegers by acting in conjunction
with General Herkimer&rsquo;s forces. This
sortie was to be made when a certain signal was
given. But the best-laid plans, as we all have
doubtless learned by experience, are not always
dependable.</p>

<p class="ind">St. Leger in this case learned of Herkimer&rsquo;s
advance and sent the savages under his command
to intercept and ambuscade him. A terrible
hand-to-hand combat ensued in which a hundred
and sixty of the colonists were killed and the loss
to the Indians was as great. General Herkimer&rsquo;s
horse was shot under him and he himself wounded
severely in the leg. Notwithstanding his agony
he insisted upon being placed with his back against
a tree for support, and therefrom he continued
to direct the battle. In the heat of the contest
he lighted his pipe and smoked.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">The further advance of the Americans to the
succor of the fort was prevented, but Colonel
Willett, in ignorance of this, made his sally from
the fort at the hour appointed. Marvelous to
state, the British were taken wholly by surprise
and, having no time to form, fled. The Americans
took possession of their supplies and their standards,
as before mentioned, and retired to the fort.</p>

<p class="ind">Failing to shell or starve them out, St. Leger
then began efforts to induce a surrender. Two
of his American prisoners were compelled to
write letters to the commandant at the fort,
exaggerating the strength of the enemy and
urging, in the name of humanity, a surrender.
To this Gansevoort returned no answer. St.
Leger then tried another plan.</p>

<p class="ind">A white flag appeared before the garrison.
Two British officers were blindfolded and admitted
to the fort. They were courteously
received and, when they were seated, were proffered
refreshments. One of the officers then
presented the message of General St. Leger, which
was in substance a threat, couched in polite language,
that if the fort was not surrendered, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Indians would be turned loose upon the country,
and not only the men but all the women and
children would be tomahawked. Not one should
escape. But if the garrison would capitulate,
not only would these evils be averted, but none
of the garrison should be injured or made prisoners.</p>

<p class="ind">Colonel Willett arose. &ldquo;I consider, Sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the message you bring a degrading one for a
British officer to send and by no means reputable
for a British officer to carry. I would suffer
my body to be filled with splinters and set on
fire, and such outrages are not uncommon in
your army, before I would deliver this garrison
to your mercy. After you get out of it, never
expect to enter it again unless you come as a
prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Provisions were running low, and some uneasiness
became manifest in the fort. Colonel
Willett, observing this, assured the men, &ldquo;I will
make a sally in the night, if compelled by lack
of supplies, and cut our way through the besiegers
or die in the attempt.&rdquo; The siege had now continued
more than twenty days, when to the surprise
of the garrison it was suddenly raised.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
This was due, it shortly appeared, to a ruse of
General Arnold; Arnold the valiant, Arnold the
traitor.</p>

<p class="ind">Among the prisoners of Arnold was a young
half-witted fellow who was condemned to death.
His sorrowing mother never ceased her pleading
with General Arnold for her son&rsquo;s life. Accordingly
one day he proposed to her this expedient: That
her son, Hon Yost by name, should make his
way to Fort Stanwix and in some way so alarm
the British that they would raise the siege. Eagerly
the old mother promised this should be done
and offered herself as hostage for the fulfillment
of the mission. To this Arnold would not consent,
but retained another son in her place.</p>

<p class="ind">Before starting on his errand, Hon Yost&rsquo;s
clothing was riddled with bullets to indicate
escape from the Americans. Reaching the camp
of the Indians, he told in a mysterious way of a
premeditated attack upon them and aroused
their fears. St. Leger heard of his arrival and
questioned him. To St. Leger he related a
touching story of his capture and miraculous
escape from execution, and by signs, words, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
gestures made it appear that he was an emissary
of Providence to aid in their preservation. Canadians,
Hessians, all became uneasy. When he
was asked the number of the Americans about
to descend upon them, Hon Yost pointed to the
leaves of the trees to indicate a legion. In his
efforts to terrorize he was ably seconded by a
young Indian who had accompanied him. Panic
seized the camps. In vain St. Leger strove to
allay the frenzy. The result was precipitate
flight.</p>

<span class="caption">When he was asked the number of the Americans

</div>

<p class="ind">It is given by one authority that St. Leger was
himself becoming as apprehensive of his red-faced
allies as he was of the enemy he was fighting.</p>

<p class="ind">The fears he had sought to instill in the minds
of the garrison were now returned upon his own
head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="THE_KNIGHT_OF_THE_SEA" id="THE_KNIGHT_OF_THE_SEA"></a>THE KNIGHT OF THE SEA</h2>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Our First European Salute</span>)</p>


<p class="cap">INSEPARABLY connected with the Stars
and Stripes must ever be the name of John
Paul Jones.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Untitled Knight of the Sea,&rdquo; the Duchess
de Chartres&mdash;mother of Louis Philippe, afterward
King of France; and granddaughter of a
high admiral of France&mdash;was fond of calling
him. For albeit John Paul Jones was of Scotch
peasant ancestry, his associates were people of
the highest intellect and rank. In appearance
he was handsome; in manner prepossessing;
and in speech he was a linguist, having at easy
command the English, French, and Spanish languages.
His surname was Paul. The name
Jones was inherited with a fine plantation in
America.</p>

<p class="ind">The call of the sea was strong to the lad and
of its dangers he had no fear. An old seaman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
one day watched him handle a fishing yawl in a
heavy storm and thought he could never weather
the squall. &ldquo;That is my son, John,&rdquo; said his
father calmly. &ldquo;He will fetch her in all right.
It is not much of a squall for him.&rdquo; The man
complimented the boy and offered him a berth
on his ship then bound for America, little dreaming
that in so doing he would carry to the New World
the Father of the American Navy.</p>

<p class="ind">Studious and ambitious, the boy devoted his
leisure moments to acquiring the most intricate
knowledge of his profession and soon held positions
of command. When the news of the battle
of Lexington reached him, he offered his services
to Congress. He was made <i>First Lieutenant of
the Alfred, and over this ship hoisted the first emblem
shown on an American naval vessel</i>. The design
of this flag was a pine tree with a rattlesnake
coiled at the roots and the motto, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tread
on me,&rdquo; on a background of yellow silk.</p>

<p class="ind">June 14th, 1777, was made notable in American
annals by the resolution passed by Congress for
a new flag. Embodied in the resolution the name
of John Paul Jones appears thus:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Resolved&mdash;That the flag of the Thirteen
United States of America be Thirteen Stripes,
alternate Red and White; that the Union be
Thirteen Stars on a Blue Field; Representing a
New Constellation:</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Resolved&mdash;That Captain John Paul Jones
be appointed to command the ship <i>Ranger</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Paul Jones&rsquo; remarks upon the resolutions were
significant: &ldquo;The flag and I are twins; born the
same hour from the same womb of destiny. We
cannot be parted in life or in death. So long as
we can float we shall float together. If we must
sink, we shall go down as one.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Before the <i>Ranger</i> was launched, Jones was
informed that he was to be the bearer of most
important news to France. This news was the
daily expected surrender of Burgoyne, the surrender
that was so powerfully to affect the result
of the war for independence. As to his fitness
for conveying such a message, Lafayette attested
thus: &ldquo;To captivate the French fancy, Captain
Jones possesses, far beyond any other officer
in your service, that peculiar aplomb, grace of
manner, charm of person, and dash of char
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>acter,&rdquo;
a compliment better understood when
it is remembered that an alliance with France
against Great Britain was then sought by Congress.</p>

<p class="ind">The <i>Ranger</i> lay in the harbor of Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, ready for sailing, and Jones
<i>with his own hands raised the flag to the masthead,
the first American flag to fly over a man-of-war</i>.
Jones had already brought credit to the
American navy by the capture of prizes in American
waters; now he was to serve his country&rsquo;s
interests off the coast of England.</p>

<p class="ind">The tang of autumn was in the air when he set
sail for France. Fulfilling his mission at Nantes,
Jones set out for Brest, where the fleet of France
was anchored. Would the Stars and Stripes, the
symbol of the New Republic across the sea, be
recognized by salute? The question was in every
mind aboard ships, and the answer eagerly awaited
in the United States. A note couched in the
diplomatic and elegant terms of which Paul Jones
was master, was sent by him to the admiral of
the French fleet, inquiring whether or not the
flag would receive recognition. &ldquo;It will,&rdquo; came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
back the answer. With that the <i>Ranger glided
gracefully through the fleet of ships; and Old Glory,
in all the radiance of her new birth and coloring,
waved response from the masthead to her first
salute from European powers</i>. We, even after
the long lapse of intervening years, feel still the
thrill of her exultation.</p>

<p class="ind">Two months later the alliance between America
and France was signed. The Duchess de Chartres
became greatly interested in the young naval
officer; and, having it in her power to advance
his interests, she one day at a dinner presented
him with a fine Louis Quintze watch that had
belonged to her grandfather, saying, &ldquo;He hated
the English; and I love the Americans.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Paul Jones&rsquo; response to the gift was as graceful
as had been the presentation. &ldquo;May it please
your Royal Highness, if fortune should favor me
at sea, I will some day lay an English frigate at
your feet.&rdquo; Two years later he did this and
more.</p>

<p class="ind">France had promised Jones a new ship better
suited to his capabilities than the <i>Ranger</i>. But
diplomatic affairs between nations move slowly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and in this case the waiting became tedious.
Jones had exhausted the pleasures of court
circles to which he had been admitted and he
longed for the life of the sea. He finally preferred
his request directly to the king and shortly
afterward was given, not the great sea monster
he had been led to expect, but an insignificant
looking craft called <i>Le Duras</i>. In compliment to
Dr. Franklin&rsquo;s magazine of the name and in humorous
comment of the ship&rsquo;s appearance, he renamed
it the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>, meaning the
<i>Poor Richard</i>. But with the <i>Poor Richard</i>, as
with the human form, the spirit which animated
it was the controlling power; and the valor of
Paul Jones was to send the name of the <i>Bon Homme
Richard</i> ringing down through the ages of all
time.</p>

<p class="ind">As Captain Jones of the <i>Ranger</i>, he had captured
the <i>Drake</i>, in a big sea fight, and surprised
England; and now, as Commodore Jones, he
was to win distinction as the greatest of naval
heroes.</p>

<p class="ind">Off the English coast at Flamborough Head,
he sighted an English fleet. The flagship was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the <i>Serapis</i>, in command of Captain Pearson.
As the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> approached the
<i>Serapis</i>, Captain Pearson raised his glass and
remarked: &ldquo;That is probably Paul Jones. If
so, there is work ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The salute affectionate between the vessels,
after the formal hail, was a broadside. Then
they fought, fought like fiends incarnate, clinched
in each other&rsquo;s arms, in the death grapple,
fought without flinching and, be it said, to the
glory of the American navy and the credit of
the English. The <i>Bon Homme</i> was on fire and
sinking. Captain Pearson, noting the situation,
called, &ldquo;Have you struck your colors?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Above the smoke and din of the conflict, Jones&rsquo;
voice answered, &ldquo;I have just begun to fight, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">He then lashed his ship to the <i>Serapis</i>, and
stood, himself, at the guns.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Shall we be quitting, Jamie?&rdquo; he said in
banter to a Scotchman at his side.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;There is still a shot in the locker, Sir,&rdquo; replied
the Scot.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Captain Pearson afterward,
&ldquo;Jones&rsquo; answer to me meant mere bravado.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
But I soon perceived that it was the defiance of a
man desperate enough, if he could not conquer,
to sink with his ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The <i>Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s</i> sides were shot
away; her prisoners loose; her decks strewn with
the dead and dying; the <i>Alliance</i>, her companion
ship, had turned traitor and fired into her. When
the fight seemed well-nigh lost, a well-directed
blow brought disaster to the <i>Serapis</i>, and she
hauled down her colors. As Captain Pearson
surrendered his sword, Commodore Jones remarked,
&ldquo;You have fought heroically, Sir. I
trust your sovereign may suitably reward you.&rdquo;
To this Captain Pearson returned no answer.</p>

<p class="ind">The wonderful combat on the sea became the
talk of all Europe. Paul Jones&rsquo; name was honored
wherever spoken. Contrary to court etiquette,
he was invited to occupy apartments in the palace
of the Duke and Duchess de Chartres. While he
was there, a banquet was tendered him. During
the progress of the dining, he called an attendant
to bring from his apartment a leather case.
This when it was opened disclosed a sword.
Turning to the duchess, the commodore asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
if she recalled his promise to lay a frigate at her
feet one day? &ldquo;Your Royal Highness perceives,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;the impossibility of keeping my
promise in kind. The English frigate proved
to be a 44 on two decks; the best I can do toward
keeping my word of two years ago, is to place
in your hands the sword of the brave officer who
commanded the English 44. I have the honor to
surrender to the loveliest woman the sword
surrendered to me by one of the bravest of men,&mdash;the
sword of Captain Richard Pearson, of his
Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s late ship the <i>Serapis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;I have the honor to surrender to the loveliest

bravest of men.&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">The Royal Order of Military Merit with the
title of Chevalier and the gift of a gold-mounted
sword were conferred upon him by the king of
France. Upon returning to America, he was
given the rank of Head of the Navy.</p>

<p class="ind">Remarkable as was the career of Paul Jones,
the winds did not always set in his favor. Many
times was his life bark driven through the
waters of bitter disappointment. But &ldquo;all that
he was, and all that he did, and all that he knew,
was the result of self-help to a degree unexampled
in the histories of great men.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The flag of the <i>Ranger</i>, saluted by the French
fleet, was transferred by Jones to the <i>Bon Homme
Richard</i>, and, says he, in his journal as given by
Buell, &ldquo;was left flying when we abandoned her;
the very last vestige mortal ever saw of the <i>Bon
Homme Richard</i> was the defiant waving of her
unconquered and unstricken flag as she went
down. And as I had given them the good old
ship for their sepulcher, I now bequeathed to my
immortal dead the Flag they had so desperately
defended, for their winding sheet.&rdquo; Here was:
&ldquo;the only flag,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;flying at the bottom
of the sea, over the only ship that ever sunk in
victory.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2><a name="WHERE_THE_STARS_AND_STRIPES" id="WHERE_THE_STARS_AND_STRIPES"></a>WHERE THE STARS AND STRIPES UNFURLED</h2>



<p class="cap">BURGOYNE was in the enemy&rsquo;s country.
He was cut off from reënforcements. His
very efforts to separate the colonies now recoiled
upon his own armies. He could neither advance
nor retreat with safety. For two weeks the opposing
armies had stood opposite each other
without fire. In desperation the British general
now hazarded another battle. After a sustained
and terrible struggle Burgoyne went down in
defeat. His best and bravest officers were lost
and seven hundred of his men were killed. General
Frazer, beloved by every British soldier and
respected by those opposed to him, had fallen
at the hands of one of Morgan&rsquo;s riflemen, of whom
it was said, they could strike an apple in mid-air
and shoot out every seed.</p>

<p class="ind">On the American side Benedict Arnold, although
divested of his command, had ridden to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the front of his old regiment and became &ldquo;the
inspiring genius of the battle.&rdquo; He charged
right into the British lines and received a severe
wound. He received also the disapproval of
General Gates and the reprimand of Congress.
The battle raged furiously until nightfall, when the
proud Briton who had boasted &ldquo;the British
never retreat&rdquo; fled under cover of the darkness.
He gained the heights of Saratoga, where he found
himself completely hemmed in by the Americans.
With but three days&rsquo; rations between his army
and starvation, he was forced to surrender. While
he was holding consultation with his officers
concerning this, a cannon ball passed over the
table at which they were sitting, and, no doubt,
hastened their conclusions.</p>

<p class="ind">Colonel Kingston was detailed to confer with the
American general on articles of capitulation.
He was conducted blindfolded to General Gates
and with him arranged the formalities. The
morning of October 17, seventeen hundred and
ninety-one British subjects became prisoners of
war. They marched to Fort Hardy on the banks
of the Hudson and, in the presence of Generals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Morgan, Wilkerson, and Lewis, laid down their
arms. The eyes of many of the men were
suffused with tears; others among them stamped
upon their muskets in anger.</p>

<p class="ind">The colors had been preserved to the British
army through the foresight of General Riedesel,
who had handed them to his wife for safe-keeping.
To the credit of the victorious Americans, it is
said, they showed no disrespect to the defeated foe.
&ldquo;General Gates,&rdquo; wrote Lieutenant Ansbury, one
of the captured officers, &ldquo;revealed exceeding
nobleness and generosity toward the captives,
commanding the troops to wheel round the
instant arms were grounded. And he, himself,
drew down the curtains of the carriage in which
he was sitting, as the troops passed him in returning.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">For the formal surrender of General Burgoyne
to General Gates a marquee had been erected near
the latter&rsquo;s old quarters. To this came the
British general and staff in full court dress. General
Gates appeared in plain clothes with nothing
to indicate his rank. As the two generals advanced
to greet each other, General Burgoyne
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
removed his hat and extending his sword, said,
&ldquo;The fortunes of war, General Gates, have made
me your prisoner.&rdquo; General Gates, not to be outdone
in polite address, returned the sword and
replied, &ldquo;I shall always be ready to bear testimony
that it has not been through any fault of
your Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The generals and their officers then sat down
to a table improvised of boards laid across barrels
and dined together most amicably, but on very
frugal fare. General Burgoyne took occasion to
compliment the discipline of the American army.
He then proposed a toast to General Washington.
General Gates then drank to the health of the king.
High above the marquee the Stars and Stripes
waved gloriously in triumph of the day of
first formal military unfurling. The turning
point of the war of the Revolution was come,
this October day, 1777.

<h2><a name="THE_YOKE_OF_BRITAIN_BROKEN" id="THE_YOKE_OF_BRITAIN_BROKEN"></a>THE YOKE OF BRITAIN BROKEN</h2>


<p class="cap">THE final scene in this stupendous drama
of American Freedom was enacted in
Virginia.</p>

<p class="ind">In September, 1781, Washington began a three
weeks&rsquo; siege against Yorktown, held by the British
under Lord Cornwallis. Finding himself there
completely surrounded by both land and water,
Cornwallis was forced to surrender.</p>

<p class="ind">Now was the yoke of Great Britain at last
broken. Seven thousand English and Hessian
soldiers and eight hundred and forty sailors laid
down their arms and became prisoners of war.</p>

<p class="ind">The formal ceremony of surrender was to take
place in an open field the last day of October.
Thousands of spectators assembled to behold
the detested Cornwallis surrender the army they
had hated and feared.</p>

<p class="ind">The Americans, commanded by General Washington
in full uniform, and the French troops,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
under Count Rochambeau, were drawn up in two
lines. At length a splendid charger issued through
the gate, bearing not the hated Cornwallis as
expected, but General O&rsquo;Hara. So overcome was
Lord Cornwallis with the consciousness of his
defeat by the &ldquo;raw Americans,&rdquo; that, feigning
illness, he refused to appear.</p>

<p class="ind">The British troops in new uniforms, in striking
contrast to the worn and faded garb of the colonists,
followed the officer with colors furled. Coming
opposite General Washington, O&rsquo;Hara saluted
and presented the sword of Cornwallis. A tense
silence pervaded the assembly. General Washington
motioned that the sword be given to General
Lincoln. Apparently forgetful of the indignities
heaped upon him by the British at Charleston,
the latter returned the sword to General O&rsquo;Hara,
remarking as he did so, &ldquo;Kindly return it to his
Lordship, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Ground arms&rdquo; came the order from the
British officers. The troops complied sullenly;
the humiliation felt by them in their defeat was
everywhere apparent.</p>

<p class="ind">The next day the conquered army marched out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of Yorktown between the American and French
troops. Their fifers, with a brave show of humor,
played, &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s turned Upside Down.&rdquo;
Washington had directed his soldiers to show no
disrespect nor unkindness to the defeated troops.
But the remembrance of &ldquo;Yankee Doodle,&rdquo; as
played by the Britons in their times of conquest,
in taunting derision of the Americans, proved
too much for the latter to endure without return,
when supreme occasion such as this offered. To
the strains of &ldquo;Yankee Doodle Do,&rdquo; from American
fifes, Lord Cornwallis and his army bade
adieu to the scenes wherein they had once marched
as conquerors.</p>

<p class="ind">In thanksgiving to God was voiced the nation&rsquo;s
exultation. Congress adjourned the sessions and
the members repaired to church to give thanks;
business was suspended in all places. Throughout
the land the voice of the people was raised
in a mighty chorus of prayer and praise to the
Almighty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="FROM_THE_OTHER_SIDE" id="FROM_THE_OTHER_SIDE"></a>FROM THE OTHER SIDE</h2>

<p class="center">(1812)</p>


<p class="cap">THE year 1812 witnessed our second war
with Great Britain. In an effort to prevent
emigration from her shores England claimed
the right to seize any of her subjects upon any
vessel of the high seas. America denied her
right to do this on American ships. Disagreement
broke into open rupture. War with the
mother country was again declared.</p>

<p class="ind">The doughty American seamen would not wait
for attack upon them, but went forth aggressively
against the squadron of the British. Oddly
enough, considering the condition of the poorly
equipped navy, they were remarkably successful
and captured more than two hundred and fifty
prizes. The following year, however, the British
gained the ascendency, and in 1814 came in with
sea force and land force and sacked and burned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the Capitol at Washington and all public buildings
except the patent office.</p>

<p class="ind">They then proceeded against Baltimore. The
land troops were almost in sight of the city of their
desires, when they were halted and held in check
by American troops under General Sticker, whose
name, it may be said, meant as it sounded, and
who effectually prevented their further advance.
But the fleet on the waters sailed into the bay of
Baltimore and up to Fort McHenry at the mouth
of the Patapsco River, in the determination to
bombard the fortress and compel entrance to the
city in that way. The British admiral had
boasted the fort would fall to his hand an easy
prey.</p>

<p class="ind">Prior to this, Dr. William Beane, a citizen of
Baltimore and a non-combatant, had been captured
at Marlboro and was held a prisoner on
one of the vessels of the British fleet. To secure
his release, Francis Scott Key and John Skinner
set out from Baltimore on the ship <i>Minden</i>
flying a flag of truce. The British admiral
received them kindly and released Dr. Beane;
but detained the three on board ship pending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the bombardment of the fort, lest in their return
to land the intentions of the British might be
frustrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/ip064.jpg" width="352" height="480" alt="Francis Scott Key" title="Francis Scott Key" />
<span class="caption">From sunrise to sunset they watched the shot and
shell poured into the fort and noted with infinite
joy that the flag still flew.</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">Thus from the side of the enemy they were
constrained to witness the efforts of destruction
urged against the protecting fortress of their own
city. From sunrise to sunset they watched the
shot and shell poured into the fort and noted
with infinite joy that the flag still flew. Through
the glare of the artillery, as the night advanced,
they caught now and then the gleam of the flag
still flying. Would it be there at another sunrise?
Who could tell! Suddenly the cannonading
ceased. The British, despairing of carrying the
fort, abandoned the project. In the emotion of
the hour and inspiration born of the victory, Key
composed the immortal lines now become our
national anthem, &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The flag is preserved in the museum of Washington
and is distinctive in having fifteen stripes
and fifteen stars, one of the very few national flags
with this number.

<h2><a name="THE_DEFENSE_OF_THE_CRESCENT_CITY" id="THE_DEFENSE_OF_THE_CRESCENT_CITY"></a>THE DEFENSE OF THE CRESCENT CITY</h2>


<p class="cap">UPON every recurrence of January the
eighth, the city of New Orleans dons gala
attire and shouts herself hoarse with rejoicing.
She chants the <i>Te Deum</i> in her Cathedrals;
and lays wreaths of immortelles and garlands of
roses and sweet-smelling shrubs upon the monument
of Andrew Jackson in Jackson Square.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;The Saviour of New Orleans,&rdquo; the inhabitants
called Jackson in the exuberance of their gratitude
for his defense of the city, and their deliverance
from threatened peril, that fateful day of
January, 1815. From capture and pillage and
divers evil things he saved her, and the Crescent
City has not forgotten.</p>

<p class="ind">Neither indeed has the nation become unmindful
of his great achievement, but upon each succeeding
anniversary of the battle of New Orleans&mdash;that
remarkable battle that gloriously ended
the War of 1812, and restored the national pride
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and honor so sorely wounded by the fall of Washington&mdash;celebrates
the event in the chief cities
of the United States.</p>

<p class="ind">During our second clash of arms with England,
the Creek War, wherein the red man met
his doom, brought Jackson&rsquo;s name into prominence.
At one bound, as it were, he sprang
from comparative obscurity into renown.</p>

<p class="ind">In 1814 he was appointed a major general in
the United States army, and established his headquarters
at Mobile. He repulsed the English
at Fort Bowyer, on Mobile Point, and awaited
orders from Washington to attack them at
Pensacola, where, through the sympathy of the
Spaniards who were then in possession of the
Florida peninsula, they had their base of operations.</p>

<p class="ind">Receiving no orders from Washington, he became
impatient of delay, and upon his own responsibility
marched his troops against Pensacola
and put the British to flight. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says
Sumner, &ldquo;was the second great step in the war in
the Southwest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Washington had been captured and her princi
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>pal
public buildings burned, and New Orleans,
the Crescent City, would now, it was thought,
be the next point of attack by the British.</p>

<p class="ind">To New Orleans, therefore, &ldquo;to defend a defenseless
city, which had neither fleets nor forts,
means nor men,&rdquo; came Jackson.</p>

<p class="ind">His entrance into the city was quiet and unostentatious
and so devoid of the pomp and
pageantry of a victorious general as to cause
question in the minds of some as to whether or
not this was the man expected. His dress was
plain in the extreme, and bore upon it no insignia
of rank; yet those there were, of insight, who saw
in his every aspect the man of power.</p>

<p class="ind">From eye and posture and gesture emanated a
certain indefinable force that attracted men to
him, and created in them an enthusiasm for his
cause. Old and young who came under his
influence were ready to do his bidding.</p>

<p class="ind">To the terrified women and children of New
Orleans who appealed to him for protection from
the enemy, he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;The British shall not enter the city except
over my dead body.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">His words and his presence inspired confidence.
And when his flag was run up above his headquarters
in Royal Street a sense of security was
felt by the inhabitants.</p>

<p class="ind">The conditions about him, however, were
far from promising, and to a less determined
spirit than that of Jackson would have been
appalling.</p>

<p class="ind">The troops under him were few in number and
poorly equipped for battle. The Crescent City
was ill equipped for defense. The governor
and the Legislature were at loggerheads.</p>

<p class="ind">As was his way in a crisis, General Jackson took
matters into his own hands.</p>

<p class="ind">He placed the city under martial law and
made every man a sailor or a soldier compelled
to the restrictions and the rules governing the
army.</p>

<p class="ind">He was aware that his action was open to severe
censure, but in the face of the object to be attained
he held this as of little consequence.</p>

<p class="ind">While engaged in examining a situation for a
fortification in one direction, the British effected
a landing in another. They had captured the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
American flotilla guarding the entrance to Lake
Borgne and were making ready to advance upon
the city.</p>

<p class="ind">This information brought consternation to the
inhabitants but not to the indomitable Jackson.
Obstacles to him were but objects to be overcome.
He swung his troops into line and went out to
meet the enemy. The advance was checked
by a sharp engagement with little loss to either
side.</p>

<p class="ind">He then set the little schooner <i>Carolina</i>,
in the Mississippi, to bombarding the levee where
the British gunners had taken refuge. With
her guns continuously roaring she kept the Britishers
at bay for three whole days, when she succumbed
to their heavy fire and exploded. Her
entire crew escaped with the exception of one
man killed and six wounded.</p>

<p class="ind">On the field of Chalmette, a few miles below
New Orleans, the opposing armies threw up
intrenchments from the same soft ooze and mud,
so close they now stood to each other. From an
upper room of the McCarte mansion house&mdash;the
home of a wealthy Creole&mdash;General Jackson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
surveyed the operations of the enemy; and
directed the movements of his own troops.</p>

<p class="ind">December the 28th an advance was made by
the British on the American lines but without
significant results. On New Year&rsquo;s Day another
attack was made.</p>

<p class="ind">In the interim between these assaults went
out an order from General Jackson to Governor
Claiborne that involved the general for years thereafter
in legal complications with the Louisiana
Legislature. News was borne to General Jackson
on the field that the Legislature was preparing
to capitulate New Orleans in the belief that the
city would be captured.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Tell Claiborne,&rdquo; said the irate Jackson, &ldquo;to
blow them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Later, he wrote to Governor Claiborne, in case
the report was true, to place a guard at the
door of the legislative hall and keep the members
in it; where they could, he satirically remarked
to a friend, have full time to make some wholesome
laws for the State without distraction from
outside matters.</p>

<p class="ind">Through mistake in the execution of the order,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the enraged lawmakers were kept outside of the
assembly hall instead of in it, and the session was
broken up.</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;" />

<p class="ind">At break of dawn that memorable day of January
8th, 1815, the British were prepared to attack.</p>

<p class="ind">Jackson and his valorous volunteers were
ready. A pygmy force were they against a mighty
one! Raw recruits contending against the trained
veterans of Wellington&rsquo;s army, led by the gallant
<a name="tn74" id="tn74"></a><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Packenham'">Pakenham</ins>!</p>

<p class="ind">The signal rocket went up.</p>

<p class="ind">The long red lines advanced over the field.</p>

<p class="ind">But to what a fate!</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot till you can see the whites of their
eyes!&rdquo;&mdash;Jackson had instructed.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;<i>Fire!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">When the smoke cleared, British soldiers, dead
and dying, thickly strewed the ground.</p>

<p class="ind">Intrenched behind their barricades of cotton
bales and sand and mud, the Americans were
scarcely touched.</p>

<p class="ind">The murderous fire went on.</p>

<p class="ind">The British columns reeled and broke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">General <a name="tn75" id="tn75"></a><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Packenham'">Pakenham</ins> heroically waved his troops
forward and fell, wounded to death.</p>

<p class="ind">General Gibbs, second in command, was struck
down.</p>

<p class="ind">General Keane was disabled.</p>

<p class="ind">The leaders were fallen! The troops were
disordered.</p>

<p class="ind">In the distance the red lines receded.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Jackson had won.</i></p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;" />

<p class="ind">In less than thirty minutes the unequal conflict
had ended, save in the silencing of the guns,
which required two hours to accomplish.</p>

<p class="ind">Never in the annals of history has such a victory
been recorded.</p>

<p class="ind">The loss to the English was two thousand
killed, wounded, and captured. The American
loss was but eight killed and thirteen wounded.</p>

<p class="ind">General Jackson marched his victorious troops
into New Orleans, where he was received with the
wildest enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="ind">The whole country applauded and rejoiced.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Andrew Jackson had become the Hero of the
Nation.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">At Ghent, two weeks before the battle, the
Treaty of Peace between England and the United
States had been signed; but the ship bearing the
news had not then reached this country.</p>

<p class="ind">But&mdash;Jackson had finished the war&mdash;had
&ldquo;finished the war in <span class="smcap">Glory</span>!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>




<h2><a name="THE_CIVIL_WAR" id="THE_CIVIL_WAR"></a>THE CIVIL WAR</h2>

<p class="center">(1861)</p>


<p class="cap">THE War between the States in 1861 was
one of the most terrible conflicts known to
modern times.</p>

<p class="ind">Many causes led up to it, chief among which
was a difference in the interpretation of the
Constitution by the people of the North and of
the South. The slavery question was also a
point of dispute; and several minor causes
brought about a dissension in the two sections
that resulted in the gigantic struggle of friend
against friend, brother against brother, father
against son.</p>

<p class="ind">The early engagements of the contending forces
were ones of signal victory to the South. The
disunion of the nation was so seriously threatened
as to bring grave concern to the Federal government.
As the weeks and months wore away,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
victory perched above the banner of the Federals,
and the climax was reached in the surrender of
General Lee at Appomattox, after four years of
deadly strife.</p>

<p class="ind">Both sides fought valiantly. Both won; in
that the glory of the Republic was to stand
henceforth supreme among foreign nations, the
greatness of the combatants to receive a recognition
never to be effaced.</p>

<p class="ind">Through a perspective of fifty years of peace,
the heroism displayed on either field by those
engaged therein is, to the most partisan observer,
silhouetted upon the mental vision in glowing
lines of light. Justly we term it &ldquo;Our most
Heroic Period.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Not the least remarkable of this aftermath,
transcending all experiences of other nations, is
the brotherhood, the kindly feeling of sympathy
and understanding, that after the passage of
but half a century now binds the once warring
sections in indissoluble bonds of unity.

<h2><a name="rsquoROUND_SHILOH_CHURCH" id="rsquoROUND_SHILOH_CHURCH"></a>&rsquo;ROUND SHILOH CHURCH</h2>


<p class="cap">WITHIN Shiloh Church that fateful day
of 1862, no sound of song or praise was
heard. But all without the leaden missiles rang
and sang in chorus of red death. Green blades
of grass, dew-tipped, sprang up to greet the sun
that April morn, but ere night fell were bowed to
earth with weight of human blood. Ne&rsquo;er before
had little church looked out on such a scene.
Ten thousand homes and hearts of North and
South were there made desolate; and twice ten
thousand men gave up their lives. The world
looked on and wondered.</p>

<p class="ind">Albert Sidney Johnston, the hero of three
wars, had staked his life and cause that April
day, for victory or defeat.</p>

<p class="ind">He met&mdash;both.</p>

<p class="ind">It was recognized by both the Northern and
Southern armies that Johnston was a formidable
antagonist. That he was a man of most magnetic
personality as well as a brave officer.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">Where he led men followed.</p>

<p class="ind">The Black Hawk War made his name familiar
throughout the country. In the War with Mexico
he won distinction.</p>

<p class="ind">As he reviewed his troops at Shiloh, he beheld
on every side his friends of other days,
and men who had served under him on other
fields.</p>

<p class="ind">When the War between the States came on,
Johnston was a brigadier general in the United
States Army; and although he was offered any
position he might desire with the Federal government,
he resigned to cast his lot with the South,
and against the land of his ancestry, for he was a
son of Connecticut. Texas had been his home,
and to the Lone Star State he felt his allegiance
due.</p>

<p class="ind">Disappointment, as pertained to his life ambitions,
had often before waited upon his footsteps
when the thing desired seemed ready to
his grasp. Yet, seeing his duty clearly, he
did it.</p>

<p class="ind">To his sister by marriage, when she, in surprise
at his action in resigning, wrote him in California,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
where he was then stationed, he replied that he
was deeply sensible of the &ldquo;calamitious condition&rdquo;
of the country; and that whatever his part thereafter
regarding it, he congratulated himself that
no act of his had aided in bringing it about; that
the adjustment of the difficulties by the sword
was not in his judgment the remedy.</p>

<p class="ind">Secession was to him a grievous thing.</p>

<p class="ind">Arriving at Richmond from the West, General
Johnston was given the command of the Western
Department of the Confederacy.</p>

<p class="ind">From September to February, 1862, he held the
line against heavy odds at Bowling Green, Ky.,
when he retreated to Corinth, Miss., where he
assembled his entire army and attacked Grant
at Shiloh Church near Pittsburg Landing,
Tenn.</p>

<p class="ind">In the flush tide of a great victory, he was
struck by a Minie ball and expired in a few
moments.</p>

<p class="ind">He rode a magnificent black animal called
&ldquo;Fire-eater.&rdquo; On horseback General Johnston
appeared to distinct advantage. The masterly
manner in which he sat his horse attracted the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
attention of the commander in chief of the army,
Thomas J. Rusk, during the Texan Revolution,
and procured him the appointment of adjutant
general over several eager aspirants for the
position.</p>

<p class="ind">As he passed along the lines to the front of the
troops at Shiloh, he raised his hat and cried out,</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;I will lead you!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">To this the men responded with a mighty cheer
and quickened movement, albeit they knew he
was leading many of them to death.</p>

<p class="ind">Hard up the slopes they pressed.</p>

<p class="ind">Nor shot, nor shell, nor falling men deterred
them.</p>

<p class="ind">The summit was reached. The Federals were
in retreat. A little apart from the others, a fine
target for the deadly marksman, the figure of
General Johnston on &ldquo;Fire-eater&rdquo; was plainly
visible.</p>

<p class="ind">His clothing was torn in places. His boot sole
was slashed by a ball, but he himself was uninjured.</p>

<p class="ind">In his countenance was reflected a satisfaction
of the day&rsquo;s results.

whistled back, whistled back and cut him down.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p class="ind">The wisdom of his decisions had been proven;
his judgment justified.</p>

<p class="ind">From the last line of the retreating Federals a
bullet whistled back, whistled back and cut him
down, did its fatal work in the very moment in
which he felt the conviction that success now
lay with the Confederate cause.</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;" />

<p class="ind">His death seemed for a time to paralyze the
further efforts of his troops, to whom his presence
had been a continual inspiration.</p>

<p class="ind">General Beauregard took command.</p>

<p class="ind">Night fell and the battle was stayed.</p>

<p class="ind">The Federals had been driven to the banks of
the Tennessee River, where the gunboats afforded
but meager protection.</p>

<p class="ind">From Nashville, General Buell arrived before
daybreak with the needed reënforcements. Lew
Wallace came in. Grant assumed the offensive;
and the afternoon of the second day of the hard-fought
contest the final victory swept to the
Federals.</p>

<p class="ind">What would have been the result to the Confederate
cause had the great leader not fallen
that first day, who can say?

<h2><a name="THE_FLAG_OF_THE_CUMBERLAND" id="THE_FLAG_OF_THE_CUMBERLAND"></a>THE FLAG OF THE CUMBERLAND</h2>


<p class="cap">THE Confederate frigate, <i>Merrimac</i>, newly
arisen from her briny bath in the Norfolk
Navy Yards, with her sides new coated in an
almost impenetrable mail of iron and rechristened
the <i>Virginia</i>, steamed slowly down the river
May 8th, 1862, to Newport News, where the
<i>Cumberland</i>, the <i>Congress</i>, and the <i>Minnesota</i>
of the Union fleet lay at anchor.</p>

<p class="ind">The crews of the latter vessels were taking life
leisurely that day, and were indulging in various
pastimes beloved of seamen. The <i>Merrimac</i> as
she hove in sight did not look especially belligerent.
Indeed she appeared &ldquo;like a house
submerged to the eaves and borne onward by
the flood.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Notwithstanding her somewhat droll appearance,
the <i>Merrimac</i> had herself well in control
and was not on a cruise of pleasure bent, as the
navies well knew.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">With steady determination she came on, until
within easy distance of the <i>Congress</i>, a vessel which
gave her greeting with a shot from one of her stern
guns, and received in response a shower of grape.</p>

<p class="ind">Broadsides were then exchanged, resulting in
fearful slaughter to the crew of the <i>Congress</i> and
damage to the guns. An officer of the <i>Congress</i>
was a favorite brother of Captain Buchanan of
the <i>Merrimac</i>. But such relation effected naught
in the exigencies of war.</p>

<p class="ind">Before the <i>Congress</i> could recover herself, the
<i>Merrimac</i> headed for the <i>Cumberland</i>. The fires
of the Cumberland, as she approached, had no
effect upon her armored sides.</p>

<p class="ind">Into the <i>Cumberland</i> she ran her powerful iron
prow, crashing in her timbers and strewing her

<h2><a name="THE_MONITOR" id="THE_MONITOR"></a>THE MONITOR</h2>


<p class="cap">TWO old Spanish ships had, prior to the sinking
of the <i>Cumberland</i>, met a like fate at the
hands of the Confederates; and the signal success
of the <i>Merrimac</i> now augured well for the break
of the blockade.</p>

<p class="ind">The South was greatly elated. The North
was disquieted.</p>

<p class="ind">Twenty-four hours later the trend of events
was changed.</p>

<p class="ind">There appeared in Hampton Roads a strange
new craft, called the <i>Monitor</i>. It was unlike any
vessel before seen, having a revolving round
tower of iron, that enabled the gunners to train
the guns on the enemy continuously, without
regard to the position of the ship. The hull had
an &ldquo;overhang,&rdquo; a projection constructed of iron
and wood, as a protection against rams.</p>

<p class="ind">The inventor and builder of this little giant
was John Ericsson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">His,</p>

<span class="i0">With iron hand, this iron thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strength and safety with speed combined.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="ind">The vessel had been launched in less than a
hundred days after the laying of the keel, in an
effort of the Federal government to have her in
service before the completion of the <i>Merrimac</i>
(the <i>Virginia</i>.)</p>

<p class="ind">The new warship attracted the attention of
the navies of Europe and brought about a change
in the construction of war vessels.</p>

<p>As if indignant at the actions of the <i>Merrimac</i>
in preceding her, and in attacking the Union fleet,
the <i>Monitor</i> bore down upon her like some live
thing bent upon retribution, and at once engaged
her in a terrific encounter.</p>

<p class="ind">With the hope born of confidence in the strength
of the Confederate ironclad, and her ability to
overpower completely the Union flotilla, boats
filled with sight-seers had gone out from Norfolk,
but with the first terrible onset of the armored
combatants speedily made their way back to
safety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">In this battle of the waters two old Naval
Academy comrades fought on opposite sides,
Lieutenant Green and Lieutenant Butt, both
well-known names.</p>

<p class="ind">For five long awful hours the strength of the
two iron monsters was pitted against each other
for supremacy on the seas, without apparent
serious injury to either vessel.</p>

<p class="ind">At last the <i>Merrimac</i> ended the gigantic contest
by turning her prow and withdrawing to Norfolk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_NIGHT_OF_CHANTILLY" id="THE_NIGHT_OF_CHANTILLY"></a>THE NIGHT OF CHANTILLY</h2>


<p class="cap">IN March, 1862, McClellan set out from Washington
to capture the Confederate capital.
At Yorktown he was held in check for a month by
an inferior force of Confederates. It was the
last of May before he reached Fair Oaks (Seven
Pines), seven miles from Richmond. The Confederates
here attacked him, and a furious battle
of two days&rsquo; duration ensued, when the Confederates
were driven back. A notable event
of this engagement was the appointment of General
Robert E. Lee, as commander in chief of the
Confederate armies; in place of General Joseph
E. Johnston, who was severely wounded.</p>

<p class="ind">One of the most conspicuous figures of this
battle of Fair Oaks was General Philip Kearney.</p>

<p class="ind">In the words of Stedman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When the battle went ill, and the bravest were solemn:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode down the length of the withering column,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sword waved us on and we answered the sign.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Kearney was the bravest man and the most
perfect soldier I ever saw,&rdquo; said General Scott.
&ldquo;A man made for the profession of arms,&rdquo; says
Rope. &ldquo;In the field he was always ready, always
skillful, always brave, always untiring, always
hopeful, and always vigilant and alert.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">He distinguished himself in the War with Mexico,
and lost an arm while he was leading cavalry
troops in close pursuit of the retreating Mexicans,
at the battle of Churubusco, when they retreated
into the city of San Antonio itself.</p>

<p class="ind">Mounted upon his great gray steed, &ldquo;Monmouth,&rdquo;
he spurred through a rampart, felling
the Mexicans as he went. A thousand arms were
raised to strike him, a thousand sabers glistened
in the air, when he hurriedly fell back, but too
late to escape the wound which necessitated the
amputation of his left arm.</p>

<p class="ind">At Churubusco ended the spectacular career of
the celebrated San Patricios battalion of Irish
deserters, who deserted to the American army on
the Canadian border and afterwards deserted
to the Mexicans from the Texan border, fighting
against the American in every Mexican war
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
battle of consequence from Palo Alto to Churubusco.
After capture the leaders and many of
the men were court-martialed and shot; their
commander, the notorious Thomas Riley, among
the latter. The survivors were branded in the
cheek with the letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; as a symbol of their
treachery.</p>

<p class="ind">General Kearney resigned from the army in 1851
and made a tour of the world. He then went to
France and fought in the war of that country
against Italy. At Magenta, while he was leading
the daring and hazardous charge that turned
the situation and won Algiers to France, <i>he charged
with the bridle in his teeth</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">For his bravery he received the Cross of the
Legion of Honor, being the first American thus
honored.</p>

<p class="ind">When the Civil War cloud burst, he came back
to the United States and was made brigadier
general in the Federal army and given the command
of the First New Jersey Brigade.</p>

<p class="ind">His timely arrival at Williamsburg saved the
day for the Federals.</p>

<p class="ind">In the engagement at Fair Oaks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Where the red volleys poured, where the clamor rose highest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the aim from the thicket was surest and nighest,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>there was no charge like Kearney&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;How he strode his brown steed! How we saw his blade brighten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the one hand still left,&mdash;and the reins in his teeth!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>General Oliver O. Howard lost his <i>right</i> arm in this
battle. When the amputation was taking place,
he looked grimly up at General Kearney, who was
present, and remarked, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll buy our gloves
together, after this.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">At Chantilly, a few days after the second battle
of Bull Run, wherein he forced the gallant Stonewall
Jackson back, he penetrated into the Confederate
lines and met his death.</p>

<p class="ind">The Confederates had won. The dusk had
fallen and General Kearney was reconnoitering
after placing his division.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;He rode right into our men,&rdquo; feelingly relates
a Confederate soldier, &ldquo;then stopping suddenly,
called out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;What troops are these?&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">Some one replied, &ldquo;Hays&rsquo; Mississippi Brigade.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">He turned quickly in an attempt to escape.
A shower of bullets fell about him. He leaned
forward as if to protect himself, but a ball struck
him in the spine. He reeled and fell.</p>

<p class="ind">Under the white flag of truce, General Lee sent his
remains to General Hooker, who had the body
transported to New York, where it was interred
with becoming honors.</p>

<h2><a name="AN_IMMORTAL_TWAIN" id="AN_IMMORTAL_TWAIN"></a>AN IMMORTAL TWAIN</h2>


<p class="cap">IT is a coincidence worthy of note, and heretofore
unremarked by historians, that, as in the
hour of birth of the National Flag there was
given to posterity the name of a great Revolutionary
hero, the hour of birth of the Confederate
Battle Emblem immortalized the name of a hero
of the Confederacy.</p>

<p class="ind">At four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of that hard-fought
battle of Manassas (Bull Run), July 21,
1861, the Federals were thinning out the lines in
gray. Now they were directing their efforts
against the wings of Jackson and Beauregard.
Jackson&rsquo;s solemn visage was growing more solemn;
Beauregard was anxiously scanning the landscape
beyond, in the hope of discovering the
approach of badly needed reënforcements.</p>

<p class="ind">Over the hill a long line was seen advancing.
The day was hot and dry and not a leaf stirred
in the dust-laden air. Clouds of smoke and grime
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
enveloped the advancing troops and obscured
their colors. General Beauregard raised his glass
and surveyed them critically.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/ip126.jpg" width="352" height="480" alt="General Beauregard" title="General Beauregard" />
<span class="caption">General Beauregard raised his glass and surveyed
them critically.</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">He then called an officer and instructed him to
go to General Johnston and inform him that the
enemy was receiving reënforcements and it might
be wise for him to withdraw to another point.
Still, he was not fully assured that the coming
troops were Federals! The flag hung limp and
motionless and could not be accurately discerned.</p>

<p class="ind">If these were Federals the day was surely lost.
But if they were Confederates there was a fighting
chance to win.</p>

<p class="ind">He determined to hold his position, and called
out,</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;What troops are those?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">No one could tell. Just then a gust of wind
spread the colors. The flag was the Stars and
Bars&mdash;General Early&rsquo;s brigade, not a moment
too soon.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;We must have a more distinct flag,&rdquo; announced
General Beauregard vehemently, in infinite
relief: &ldquo;One that we can recognize when
we see it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">In that instant was conceived the Confederate
Battle Flag, used thereafter throughout the Civil
strife.</p>

<p class="ind">After the battle, the design&mdash;St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Cross&mdash;was submitted by General Beauregard,
and, approved by General Joseph E. Johnston,
was adopted by the Confederate Congress.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Conceived on the field of battle, it lived on the
field of battle, and was proudly borne on every
field from Manassas to Appomattox.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;" />

<p class="ind">The Confederates were routed and running in
disorder. General Jackson was standing immovable.
General Bee rode to his side. &ldquo;They will
beat us back!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; replied Jackson, &ldquo;we will give them
the bayonet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">General Bee rode back to his brigade. &ldquo;Look
at Jackson,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;standing there like a
stone wall. Rally behind him.&rdquo; With this his
brigade fell into line.</p>

<hr style="visibility: hidden; margin: 1.5em;" />

<p class="ind">Early&rsquo;s troops arrived and formed. The
Federals were beaten into a tumultuous retreat
that never slacked until Centerville was reached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="ind">From that day the name &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; attached
to Thomas Jonathan Jackson and was
peculiarly appropriate as indicating the adamantine,
unyielding character of the man.</p>

<p class="ind">The motto of his life was: &ldquo;A man can do what
he wills to do,&rdquo; and in his resolves he depended
for guidance upon Divine leading. He tried
always to throw a religious atmosphere about his
men; and out of respect to his feelings, if for no
other reason, they often refrained from evil. His
mount was a little sorrel horse, that the men
affirmed was strikingly like him as it could not
run except towards the enemy.</p>

<p class="ind">The ardent love of his troops for him made the
tragedy of his death the more deplorable. Mistaking
him for the enemy as he was returning
from the front, in the gathering darkness at
Chancellorsville, May, 1863, his own men shot
him,&mdash;shot him down with victory in his grasp.</p>

<p class="ind">The whole country was horror-struck. Friend
and foe alike paused in sympathy at such a situation.</p>

<p class="ind">To the Southern cause it was more than the
taking off of a leader; it was an irreparable loss.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
By his death was left a gap in the Confederate
ranks that no one else could fill.</p>

<p class="ind">Prior to the breaking out of the war Jackson
had been unknown, but in the two years of his
service he accomplished more than any other
officer on his side. He saved Richmond from
early fall by keeping the Union forces apart,
until he was joined by Lee, when together they
drove McClellan from within a few miles of the
Confederate Capital and cleared the James River
of gunboats.</p>

<p class="ind">In his report from Chancellorsville, General
Robert E. Lee pays tribute to the illustrious officer
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;The movement by which the enemy&rsquo;s position
was turned and the fortune of the day decided,
was conducted by the lamented Lieutenant
General Jackson, who, as has already been stated,
was severely wounded near the close of the engagement
Saturday evening. I do not propose here
to speak of the character of this illustrious man,
since removed from the scene of his eminent usefulness,
by the hand of an inscrutable but all-wise
Providence. I nevertheless desire to pay the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
tribute of my admiration to the matchless energy
and skill that marked this last act of his life,
forming as it did a worthy conclusion of that long
series of splendid achievements which won for
him the lasting love and gratitude of his country.</p>

<h2><a name="OLD_HEART_OF_OAK" id="OLD_HEART_OF_OAK"></a>OLD HEART OF OAK</h2>


<p class="cap">TO the Navy is ascribed the larger shares in
the Civil War, of overcoming the prowess
of the South. &ldquo;The blockade sapped the industrial
strength of the Confederacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">A powerful factor in this blockade was David G.
Farragut. Farragut was a Southerner by birth&mdash;a
Tennessean&mdash;and fought, as it were, against
his own hearthstone. Yet, when it is considered
that from early youth he was in the marine service
of the government and by arms upheld the
national flag, and when it is remembered with
what reverence the seaman regards the flag under
which he serves, his choice is not surprising.</p>

<p class="ind">Scenes wherein men fought and died for the
Stars and Stripes and often with their dying breath
expressing adoration of the nation&rsquo;s emblem were
common experiences of his life.</p>

<p class="ind">In his memoirs is related a pathetic story of a
youth&rsquo;s death from accidental shooting. &ldquo;Put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
me in the boat,&rdquo; implored he of his comrades,
&ldquo;that I may die under my country&rsquo;s flag.&rdquo; Another,
a young Scotchman, who had a leg cut off
in battle, cried out mournfully, &ldquo;I can no longer
be of use to the flag of my adoption,&rdquo; and threw
himself overboard.</p>

<p class="ind">The necessity of choosing between the North
and the South brought Farragut many sleepless
nights and forced him between the fires of censure
from the South and doubt of his fealty from the
North, as it was recognized that the Southern
man, as a rule, felt that his first allegiance was
due to his State.</p>

<p class="ind">When he was but a lad of seven years, Farragut
lost his mother and was adopted by his father&rsquo;s
friend, that fighting old Commodore David
Porter, who was destined to raise both his adopted
and his own son to become admirals in the United
States Navy.</p>

<p class="ind">For little Dave Farragut the sea had always a
wonderful fascination, and at the age of twelve he
was made a midshipman on the <i>Essex</i>, a warship
of 1812. The <i>Essex</i> one day captured a whaling
vessel, and Captain Porter placed David in charge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to steer her across the Pacific. The captain of
the whaler, when clear of the <i>Essex</i>, thought to
regain his vessel from the boy, by countermanding
his orders. He threatened to shoot any sailor
who dared to disobey him. Right here, the
mettle that was to make Farragut the head of the
American navy and the idol of the American
people manifested itself. He repeated his order
at first given; and when the mutinous captain
appeared from below decks where he had gone
for his pistols, he was told by the youthful commander
that he would have to stay below or be
thrown overboard. He chose the former.</p>

<p class="ind">To this same dauntless spirit, the Federal
government owed the blockade of the lower
Mississippi and the closing of the ports of Mobile
Bay, that inflicted such injuries upon the Confederacy
as to hasten the end of the war. &ldquo;With
ports closed,&rdquo; says an authority, &ldquo;the Southern
armies were reduced to a pitiful misery, the long
endurance of which makes a noble chapter in
heroism.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The lower Mississippi was controlled by the
Confederates. Possession of the river and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
capture of New Orleans could be accomplished
only by running the forts situated below the city
some seventy miles. To run the forts with wooden
vessels and escape destruction from the armed
vessels of the Confederacy in the Mississippi
was a hazardous undertaking. Farragut believed
he could do this. In December, 1861, he wrote to
a friend: &ldquo;Keep your lips closed and burn my
letters. Perfect silence is the first injunction of
the Secretary. I am to have a <i>flag</i> in the gulf,
and the rest depends upon myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">In March he again wrote, &ldquo;I have now attained
what I have been looking for all my life&mdash;a <i>flag</i>&mdash;and
having attained it, all that is necessary
to complete the scene is a victory.&rdquo; The victory
he was soon to have.</p>

<p class="ind">At two o&rsquo;clock the morning of April 24, 1862,
the signal for the start for the forts was given.
In a few moments the thunderous roar of batteries
and guns broke upon the air. The river became
a mass of writhing flame.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;The passing of Forts Jackson and St. Phillips
was one of the most awful sights and events I
ever saw or expect to experience,&rdquo; says Farragut.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Rafts of cotton were set on fire by the Confederates
and came down the river, scattering disaster
as they came. One of these caught the <i>Hartford</i>,
Farragut&rsquo;s flagship, and set it on fire. So high
rose the flames that even the courageous commander
was for the moment daunted and exclaimed,
&ldquo;My God! is this to end this way!&rdquo;
By the expeditious use of the hose the flames
were controlled.</p>

<p class="ind">The strong barriers across the river were broken.
By repeated and desperate efforts the Confederate
boats were sunk or disabled. The levee at New
Orleans was gained. The Crescent City was
taken.</p>

<p class="ind">Thus was accomplished a feat in naval warfare
reckoned without a parallel in naval history,
except in that of twenty-four months later in
Mobile Bay. In compliment to his exploit the
rank of rear admiral was conferred upon Farragut.
Of the fleet, as subordinate officers, were
Dewey and Schley, a future admiral and a rear-admiral.</p>

<p class="ind">To his home, the victorious commander addressed
the following letter:

<p>&ldquo;My dearest Wife and Boy.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;I am so agitated I can scarcely write, and I
shall only tell you that it has pleased Almighty
God to preserve my life through a fire such as the
world has scarcely known.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">When the ships lay safely at the levee with but
one of the squadron lost, Farragut by note requested
the mayor of New Orleans to remove the
Confederate flag and to surrender the city formally.
In curt terms the doughty mayor refused
to do so, stating there was not in the city of New
Orleans a man who would take down that flag.
Then ensued a most unique correspondence
between the two, through which Farragut made
himself misunderstood to the extent that it was
rumored that it was his intention to turn the guns
on the city. At the expiration of forty-eight hours,
however, an officer of the fleet removed the offending
flag and hoisted the Stars and Stripes
over the city hall.</p>

<p class="ind">To injure purposely the defenseless, as in
turning the guns on the city, was not in keeping
with the nature of David Farragut as revealed
in history. Power combined with gentleness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
were the marked traits of his character. This
gentleness had its finest reflex in his delicate
attentions to his invalid wife. In the presence
of her continuous suffering his warrior nature
was laid aside, and his chivalric kindness shone
forth in acts of rare devotion and tender
care.</p>

<p class="ind">When he was asked one day, as to his feelings
during a battle in seeing men fall writhing upon
every side, he answered, &ldquo;I thought of nothing
but the working of the guns; but after the battle,
when I saw the mangled bodies of my shipmates,
dead and dying, groaning and expiring often with
the most patriotic sentiments upon their lips,
I became faint and sick. My sympathies were
all aroused.&rdquo; Markedly noticeable in his letters
is the absence of self-elation over his victories.
There are, rather, a rejoicing in the advancement
of his cause and gratitude to the Almighty for
preservation. In this we read anew the lesson
of true greatness.</p>

<p class="ind">Just prior to entering into the noted action of
Mobile Bay, he wrote his son respecting his views
of duty and death. &ldquo;He who dies in doing his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
duty to his country, and at peace with his God,
has played out the drama of life to the best advantage.&rdquo;
Shortly after this was penned, the
<i>Hartford</i> was steaming into Mobile Bay, under
the heavy fire of guns of Fort Morgan and Fort
Gaines, in the execution of a naval feat that attracted
the attention and admiration of the
whole civilized world.</p>

<span class="caption">The Battle of Mobile Bay.</span>
</div>

<p class="ind">At the mouth of the bay the two islands upon
which the forts stood were less than a mile apart.
The passage had been strewn with torpedoes by
the Confederates, and only a narrow strip of
water was left clear. Through this strip went
Farragut&rsquo;s fleet: the <i>Tecumseh</i> first, the <i>Brooklyn</i>
next, the <i>Hartford</i> third. Suddenly the prow
of the <i>Tecumseh</i> lifted: she veered and sank.
The <i>Brooklyn</i> backed and held Farragut&rsquo;s ship
directly under the guns of Fort Morgan. Shot
and shell hurtled in the air. The smoke grew
dense. The fire from the cannons lit the heavens.
Men shouted and fell.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter!&rdquo; called Farragut.</p>

<p class="ind">&ldquo;Torpedoes,&rdquo; some one answered.</p>

<p class="ind">Never a profane man, he now gave vent to an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
oath, and cried out, &ldquo;Full speed, Jouett. Four
bells, Captain Drayton.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The <i>Hartford</i> steamed to the front. The
torpedoes crackled under her as she sped on; but
the forts were passed. And high in the rigging
of his ship, in full view of the enemy and imminent
danger of the fiery missiles, was seen Farragut,
whence he directed all the ships&rsquo; maneuvers.
An officer, observing him standing there, feared
lest a shot would cause his fall, and carried a rope
and lashed him to the mast.</p>

<p class="ind">In maddened fury the ironclad <i>Tennessee</i>
plunged straight at the <i>Hartford</i>. All the fleet
bore down upon the Confederate ship. And
crowding together, the <i>Lackawanna</i>, needing
room, struck the flagship by accident, and came
near striking the commander. Against the
<i>Tennessee</i> every Federal ship now redoubled her
efforts, until, battered and bruised and despairing,
she struck her colors.</p>

<p class="ind">The captain of the <i>Tennessee</i> was Buchanan,
the same who commanded the <i>Merrimac</i> in her
fight with the <i>Monitor</i> in Hampton Roads. &ldquo;The
<i>Tennessee</i> and Buchanan are my prisoners,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&rdquo;
wrote Farragut home. &ldquo;He has lost a leg. It
was a hard fight, but Buck met his fate manfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines surrendered and
Farragut&rsquo;s fierce conflicts were at an end. Nearly
so was his path of life. Congress honored him
with the rank of admiral, the highest honor to be
conferred. America and foreign nations extended
him the most distinguishing courtesies. And
then&mdash;the unseen Pilot steered his course across
the unknown sea unto the harbor of the city
Eternal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="PINE_AND_PALM" id="PINE_AND_PALM"></a>PINE AND PALM</h2>

<p class="center">(GRANT AND LEE)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Charles Francis Adams in address before Chicago
Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, June 17, 1902.</p></div>


<p class="capi">I NOW come to what I have always regarded&mdash;shall
ever regard as the most creditable
episode in all American history,&mdash;an episode
without a blemish,&mdash;imposing, dignified, simple,
heroic. I refer to Appomattox. Two men met
that day, representative of American civilization,
the whole world looking on. The two were
Grant and Lee,&mdash;types each. Both rose, and
rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion,&mdash;and
than that occasion there has been
none greater. About it and them, there was no
theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort
at effect. A great crisis was to be met; and they
met that crisis as great countrymen should.</p>

<p class="ind">That month of April saw the close of exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
four years of persistent strife,&mdash;a strife which
the whole civilized world had been watching
intently. Then, suddenly, came the dramatic
climax at Appomattox, dramatic I say, not
theatrical,&mdash;severe in its simple, sober, matter-of-fact
majesty. The world, I again assert, has
seen nothing like it; and the world, instinctively,
was at the time conscious of the fact. I like to
dwell on the familiar circumstances of the day;
on its momentous outcome; on its far-reaching
results. It affords one of the greatest educational
object lessons to be found in history; and the
actors were worthy of the theater, the auditory,
and the play.</p>

<p class="ind">A mighty tragedy was drawing to a close. The
breathless world was the audience. It was a
bright, balmy April Sunday in a quiet Virginia
landscape, with two veteran armies confronting
each other; one game to the death, completely
in the grasp of the other. The future was at
stake. What might ensue? What might not
ensue? Would the strife end then and there?
Would it die in a death-grapple, only to reappear
in that chronic form of a vanquished but indomi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>table
people, writhing and struggling, in the grasp
of an insatiate but only nominal victor?</p>

<p class="ind">The answer depended on two men,&mdash;the captains
of the contending forces. Think what then
might have resulted had these two men been other
than what they were,&mdash;had the one been stern
and aggressive, the other sullen and unyielding.
Most fortunately for us, they were what and
who they were,&mdash;<i>Grant and Lee. Of the two, I
know not to which to award the palm.</i> Instinctively,
unconsciously, they vied not unsuccessfully
each with the other, in dignity, magnanimity,
simplicity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="THE_CONQUERED_BANNER" id="THE_CONQUERED_BANNER"></a>THE CONQUERED BANNER</h2>


<p class="cap">LIKE several other poems of renown, &ldquo;The
Conquered Banner&rdquo; was written under
stress of deep emotion.</p>

<p class="ind">Abram J. Ryan (Father Ryan) had been
ordained as a Catholic priest. Shortly after his
ordination he was made a chaplain in the Confederate
army.</p>

<p class="ind">When the news came of General Lee&rsquo;s surrender
at Appomattox he was in his room in Knoxville,
where his regiment was quartered.</p>

<p class="ind">He bowed his head upon the table and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p class="ind">He then arose and looked about him for a piece
of paper, but could find nothing but a sheet of
brown paper wrapped about a pair of shoes.
Spreading this out upon the table, he, &ldquo;in a spirit
of sorrow and desolation&rdquo; as expressed in his own
words, wrote upon it &ldquo;The Conquered Banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">The following morning the regiment was ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
away, and the poem upon the table was forgotten.
To the author&rsquo;s surprise it appeared over his
name, in a Louisville paper, a few weeks later,
having been forwarded to the paper by the lady
in whose house he had stopped in Knoxville.</p>

<p class="ind">The poem was widely copied, and was read at
gatherings throughout the South with ardor and
often with tears.</p>

<p class="ind">As an expression of sorrow without bitterness
it is considered a fine example.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="OLD_GLORY_ON_THE_ISLAND" id="OLD_GLORY_ON_THE_ISLAND"></a>OLD GLORY ON THE ISLAND</h2>


<p class="cap">MEN who have had grave differences and
looked at each other coldly and passed
with unsmiling faces have, when some calamity
threatened, sprang shoulder to shoulder and
spent their united strength in defense of a common
cause.</p>

<p class="ind">Thus in the Spanish-American spurt of war,&mdash;serious
enough, too serious, alas, in some aspects;
but great in some of its beneficent results. In
that call, &ldquo;To Arms!&rdquo; was laid to rest&mdash;forever
forgotten&mdash;the old enmity between the
North and the South, engendered by the Civil
Strife.</p>

<p class="ind">On the island of Cuba, the trenches of the
United States Army were five miles in extent and
in shape of a horseshoe. Above the trenches,
five curving miles of <i>Stars and Stripes</i> gleamed.</p>

<p class="ind">To the United States prisoners, confined in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
prison, within sight of these flags, but <i>under the
flag of Spain</i>, the waving emblems before their
eyes brought daily hope and courage.</p>

<p class="ind">In full vision of the men in the trenches
fluttered the flag of Spain; above their heads
Old Glory flew,&mdash;the sheltering Stripes and
Stars.</p>

<p class="ind">As night came down, and land and shimmering
sea was bathed in the white light of the sub-tropics,
the strains of the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo;
were borne upon the air and fell away softly, as
if coming from across the water. Every man
uncovered and stood with silent lips, and eyes
fixed upon Old Glory until the last echoing note
died in the distance, then turned again to duties;
but upon his face was stamped the deeper understanding
of the meaning of it all&mdash;<i>of Flag, and
Home, and Country</i>.</p>
